    Before it turned into an art that 
    involved culinary expertise, food
    in India was about rasas and 
    doshas. Taste or rasa in Sanskrit 
    guides the tongue and it is a balance
    or misbalance of these rasas that
    cause or correct the doashas in
    body. In short, whatever one eats
    is believed to be the cause and
    cure of all ailments. Thus,
    food has been as much and art a
    a science in our culture which revolves
    round a delightful culinary 
    tradition. Here are some interesting
    facts about Indian food.
    Indian food is said to be based on 
    six kinds of tastes (rasas)- Sweet(madhura),
    Salty (lavana), Sour(amala), Pungent(katu),
    Bitter (tikta) and Astringent (kasya).
